# CellProfiler Analysis 

We used CellProfiler to generate the nuclear and cytoplasmic segmentation, measure the properties of interest, and object tracking for live cell imaging. Below is a summary of the main stages in the pipeline, expected output and optimisation. 

## Stages of the CellProfiler Analysis 
The different stages of the "CellProfier_pipeline.cpproj" pipeline, shown in the white tab on the left, are explained below: 

|Stage|Purpose|
|------|------|
_Images_|Image input for segmentation. This pipeline quires: <br /> 1) Modified SiR-DNA images from Fiji (for nuclear segmentation) <br />2) Cell objects generated from CellPose (for cytoplasmic segmentation) <br />3) Original SiR-DNA and KTR images to measure intentisy etc. Upload individual .tiff files for each channel or stack .tiff file for each channel of live imaging experiment
_Metadata_|Modify depending on experiment. For live imaging experiments, indicate stacked .tiff file contains timepoints to facilitate object tracking. 
_NamesAndTypes_|Categorizes uploaded images:<br /> 1)Modified sir-DNA images are called ‘Edited_DAPI’<br />2)Original SiR-DNA and KTR images are called ‘Original_DAPI’ and ‘KTR’ respectively<br />3)Cell objects generated from CellPose are converted to CellProfiler objects called ‘Cell_mask_raw’ 
_Groups_|Groups the input images by frames to facilitate extracting downstream. 
_EditObjectsManually_|Optional step 1: Manual correction of CellPose segmentation errors. 
_IdentifyPrimaryObjects_|Identifies individual objects as “Nucleus_raw” using the modified SiR-DNA images ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46695970/122502613-85164d80-d029-11eb-99e4-c1775642ac30.png)
_EditObjectsManually_|Optional step 2: Manually correction of nuclear CellProfiler segmentation errors. 
_RelateObjects_|Since the nuclear and cell objects are identified by two different softwares (CellPose and CellProfiler), the cell and its corresponding nucleus are labelled with a different number. This steps relabels each nucleus and corresponding cell mask with the same object number.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46695970/122503879-c576cb00-d02b-11eb-8214-06090e60c2fb.png)
_IdentifyTertiaryObjects_|Generates a cytoplasm mask by subtracting the nucleus from the CellPose cell masks.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46695970/122503782-a2e4b200-d02b-11eb-9952-6f17d5bb4565.png) 
_IdentifyTertiaryObjects_|Optional step 3_part 1: Cells with little cytoplasmic signal (e.g. dividing cells) often do not generate a CellPose cell mask and are therefore lost. However, successfully tracking cells across division requires that such cells are included in the analysis. The subsequent steps allow including cells that have nuclear-only signal. <br /> _IdentifyTertiaryObjects_ function identifies the subset of the original nuclei objects that have a CellPose mask associated with them (Nucleus_2). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46695970/122505682-6f0b8b80-d02f-11eb-975e-4f8845b13a0d.png)
_IdentifyTertiaryObjects_| Optional step 4: Repeat of the step above, but the smaller object is shrunk prior to subtraction. Called Nucleus_2_fortracking, this generates microscopy images with the nucleus and the CellPose cell mask boundary. It is not used for data analysis, but provides an easy way to visualise the object tracking tool downstream of the CellProfiler analysis tool. More details are explained below. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46695970/122509913-353e8300-d037-11eb-89c3-a3cfc8bc1d10.png)
_IdentifyTertiaryObjects_| Optional step 3_part 2: Subtract the Nucleus_2 subset from the Nucleus_raw subset to obtain the Leftover_nucleus, a set of nuclei that do not have a CellPose mask associated with it. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46695970/122508179-21dde880-d034-11eb-934e-f88d8e9c900a.png)
_IdentifySecondaryObjects_|To identify dividing cells and cells with a nuclear-only signal, the Nucleus_2 subset is expanded by 5 pixels to check the surrounding intensity of the nuclei. If there is a high-value cytoplasmic intensity around the nucleus, this cell is likely to be normal, and that there was some error in CellPose. If the surrounding intensity is minimal and near background intensity, this cell is likely to be a dividing cell or a cell with nuclear-only signal. These cells can then be labelled and properties can be analyzed separately. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46695970/122510056-7fbfff80-d037-11eb-91d9-8eeb57bbbe04.png)
_DisplayDataonImage_|Number labels for each cell object is overlaid onto the KTR channel to assist data analysis. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46695970/122509968-50a98e00-d037-11eb-8410-6c0d9a8e6b9c.png)
_DisplayDataonImage_|Number labels for each nuclear object is overlaid onto the SiR-DNA channel to assist data analysis. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46695970/122509984-5ef7aa00-d037-11eb-870d-9fca3b48b149.png)
_MeasureObjectIntensity_<br />_MeasureObjectIntensityDistribution_<br />_MeasureObjectNeighbors_<br />_MeasureObjectSizeShape_| Properties of our choosing are then measured for data analysis. 
_TrackObjects_| Nucleus_2_fortracking is tracked over different frames in a live-cell imaging video. This tracking is purely for visualization and ease of checking for errors during tracking or segmentation. 
_TrackObjects_| Nucleus_2 is tracked over different frames in the live-cell imaging video. With this tracking tool, objects will be labelled with the same number under "TrackObjectsLabel" across different frames. 
_ExportToSpreadsheet_| All data generated is exported into a spreadsheet for further analysis. 
_SaveImages_| Visualizations of the tracking, labelled images from _DisplayDataonImage_ will be saved to the output folder

## Optimizable Parameters 

### Nuclear Segmentation
The key parameters to optimise the nuclear segmentation in _IdentifyPrimaryObjects_ are shown below: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46695970/122512275-35d91880-d03b-11eb-8599-7b3f984f0d12.png)

### Object Tracking
There is an in-built object tracker in CellProfiler which allows tracking objects across frames. 

Under _Choosing a tracking method_, multiple tracking methodologies can be used.

Note: Distance, Overlap and Fellow Neighbors tracking methods rely on tracking cells across successive frames. If an object is missing from a frame through segmentation errors, etc (see Optional step 3) the software will fail to relate the objects across frames and a new track will be created. The LAP method can track objects across multiple frames but it requires substantial optimisation. In our hands, it was more efficient to manually correct missing objects (Optional steps 1, 2 and 3) to minimise tracking errors.

Using the Distance method, the _Maximum pixel distance to consider matches_ parameter was optimized based on trial and error. Saving the color-coded images in the _TrackObjects_ function allows manually inspecting the accuracy of the object tracking.

### Property Measurement
The nuclear and cytoplasmic properties to measure and export can be selected under the _MeasureObjectIntensity_, _MeasureObjectIntensityDistribution_, _MeasureObjectNeighbors_,_MeasureObjectSizeShape_ and _ExportToSpreadsheet_ modules. The current pipeline exports Image Number, Object Number, Intensity, Eccentricity of shape, Area, Perimeter, Distance to Nearest Neighbour, Nearest Neighbour Object Number, Location for the nucleus and cytoplasm separately in all images.
