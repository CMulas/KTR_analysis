# CellProfiler Analysis 

In this stage of the pipeline, we will generate the nuclear segmentation, measure the properties of our choosing for the nucleus and cytoplasm, and conduct object tracking for live cell imaging. We will first explain the main stages in the pipeline and the expected output for each stage. Details for optimizable parameters will then be discussed. 

## Stages of the CellProfiler Analysis 
If you download the "CellProfier_pipeline.cpproj" file, you will see that there are multiple stages in the pipeline as denoted in the white tab on the left of the software. A description of the purpose of each stage is explained in the table below: 

Stage	Purpose
Images	"Input the required images for segmentation. In this pipeline, we have added the: 
1) Modified SiR-DNA images from Fiji
2) Original SiR-DNA and KTR images for property measurement later 
3) Cell objects generated from CellPose"
