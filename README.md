# KTR_analysis

Kinase Translocation Reporters (KTRs) are an effective method to quantify intracellular signalling pathways. When the protein of interest is phosphorylated, KTRs exit the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Measuring the cytoplasmic to nuclear activity will be an indication of protein activity. This pipeline facilitates image analysis by calculating the cytoplasmic-nuclear ratio for dividing cells in live-cell imaging videos. 

In this analysis example, samples were imaged using SiR-DNA and DHB-mVenus (KTR for CDK2 activity). Example images have been uploaded under the 'Example Data' folder.

## Image Analysis Pipeline 

The pipeline consists of 3 stages as denoted below: 
1. ImageJ: modify original image
